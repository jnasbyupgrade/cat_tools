# Claude Code Instructions for cat_tools

## Git

**Never delete a branch without explicit user approval.** This includes `git push origin --delete`, `git branch -d`, and `git branch -D`. Always ask first.

**Always open PRs against the main repo** (`Postgres-Extensions/cat_tools`), not a fork.

## Code Style

### Comments
Always use block comment format for multi-line comments in SQL files:

```sql
/*
 * First line of comment.
 * Second line of comment.
 */
```

Never use `--` line comments for multi-line explanations.
