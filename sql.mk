# sql.mk -- versioned SQL generation and everything that depends on it.
#
# Owns `include pgxntool/base.mk` (which pulls in control.mk and, at its end,
# PGXS), included at the top of this file before the DATA/rules below. The
# Makefile includes THIS file (once) and does NOT include base.mk itself:
# base.mk has no include guard, so a second include causes "overriding recipe"
# errors (upstream: https://github.com/Postgres-Extensions/pgxntool/issues/50).
# The code below uses vars from those includes: EXTENSION__CURRENT_VERSION__FILES
# (control.mk); PG_CONFIG / MAJORVER / $(call test,...) (base.mk); datadir (PGXS).
#
# ============================================================================
# GNU Make is TWO-PHASE, and we GENERATE the .sql we install -- beware.
# ============================================================================
# Phase 1 (parse) expands every $(wildcard ...) and CACHES directory listings
# before any recipe runs. Phase 2 (recipes) then generates our versioned SQL
# (sql/cat_tools--X.Y.Z.sql install scripts and sql/cat_tools--A.B.C--X.Y.Z.sql
# update scripts) from .sql.in sources. Those generated .sql are gitignored (see
# sql/.gitignore) and absent on a clean tree at parse time, so any parse-time
# $(wildcard) over them comes up short -- and the cached listing means Make never
# notices them later either.
#
# https://github.com/Postgres-Extensions/cat_tools/issues/28 is the canonical
# symptom: base.mk seeds DATA with $(wildcard sql/*--*--*.sql), a phase-1 glob
# that misses our generated update scripts on a clean tree, so `make install`
# skips them and a later `ALTER EXTENSION cat_tools UPDATE` fails with "no update
# path".
#
# The rule this file follows: glob what git TRACKS; name-DERIVE what we generate.
# We build the install/update lists from the .sql.in SOURCE names (present at
# parse time), not from the generated .sql, then add those names to DATA and
# $(sort) to dedup against base.mk's own wildcard. Such lists are parse-stable:
# identical on a clean tree and a built tree.
# ============================================================================

# See header: base.mk must be included exactly once, before the DATA/rules below.

# cat_tools--0.1.*.sql are the exception: committed directly (no .sql.in source),
# so they're always present at Make's parse time regardless of build state --
# base.mk's own DATA wildcard (sql/*--*.sql, widened in pgxntool 2.3.0 to match
# both dash counts) already picks them up on its own; we don't need to add them

# relkind drift source generation

# Generate the canonical set of pg_class.relkind values from the server headers
# we are building against, for the relkind drift check in test/sql/relation__.sql.
# The output is gitignored (per-version). When postgresql-server-dev-NN is not
# installed the script emits an empty view so `make test` still works locally;
# CI runs check-relkind-source (below) so a missing header can never let the
# drift check pass silently, and `make test` warns about it locally.

# Stamp recording the header path. FORCE runs the recipe every time, but it only
# rewrites the stamp (bumping its mtime) when the path actually changed, so the

# header file itself is untouched. This is the same "name-derive the source"
# trick as versioned_out, but for a source (a server header) that lives OUTSIDE
# the tree: we cannot glob it into the dependency graph reliably, so we track its

# added to or removed from it, so as a normal prerequisite it would force
# needless regeneration on every run; after `|` it means "ensure it exists, but

# FUTURE CLEANUP: once support for the relevant old PG versions is dropped, a
# .sql.in whose only version-conditional content targets those versions can be
# frozen to a raw committed .sql (dropping its .sql.in and thus its share of this
# processing chain). Precedent: the historical cat_tools--0.1.*.sql are already

# Two .sql.in sources feed the same .sql.in -> .sql transform below (wrap with
# @generated@ markers, then _apply_version_seds), producing two different
# targets:
#
#   sql/cat_tools.sql.in (hand-maintained master, committed)
#     --pattern rule-->  sql/cat_tools.sql
#
#   sql/cat_tools.sql.in
#     --copy rule, tags @generated@ as "VERSIONED FILE!"-->
#       sql/cat_tools--X.Y.Z.sql.in (committed per-version snapshot; frozen
#       once released, see CLAUDE.md's SQL file conventions)
#         --override rule, same transform as the pattern rule-->
#           sql/cat_tools--X.Y.Z.sql = $(EXTENSION__CURRENT_VERSION__FILES)
#           (what CREATE EXTENSION actually installs)
#
# The bottom (override) rule can't just be left to the sql/%.sql pattern rule
# matching it: control.mk (auto-generated by pgxntool from cat_tools.control,
# see pgxntool/base.mk) already defines its OWN recipe for
# $(EXTENSION__CURRENT_VERSION__FILES) -- straight from cat_tools.sql, no .sql.in layer,
# no version seds -- and GNU Make always prefers an explicit rule over a
# pattern rule for the same target. Overriding it here is the only way to
# route that target through the same .sql.in / version-sed pipeline as
# everything else; its "overriding recipe" warning is expected. Both final
# steps build $@.tmp then move it into place atomically.
#
# TODO: refactor the version handling into a function.

# @generated@ becomes the "-- GENERATED FILE! DO NOT EDIT!" marker below via a
# plain, unanchored substring match -- it also fires on a handful of
