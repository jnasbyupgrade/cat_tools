# Committed-once install of the extension + test roles.
#
# test/install/load.sql is the ONE place that installs everything the pgTAP
# suite depends on (the extension and the test roles + grants). pgxntool's
# native test/install feature runs it COMMITTED, before the suite, in its own
# pg_regress session; the state persists into every (rolled-back) test. So the
# per-test files no longer each reinstall -- a real time saver. We enable it in
# BOTH modes (install always happens via test/install), so it must be `yes`
# unconditionally here.
PGXNTOOL_ENABLE_TEST_INSTALL = yes
#
# TEST_LOAD_SOURCE selects how load.sql installs the extension:
#   - fresh (default): CREATE EXTENSION cat_tools (current version).
#   - update: CREATE EXTENSION at TEST_UPDATE_FROM (default 0.2.2, the
#     backward-compat floor) then ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE -- to TEST_UPDATE_TO if
#     set, otherwise to the current version. Running the SAME suite with the SAME
#     expected output against the updated database verifies it behaves
#     identically to a fresh install.
#   - existing: the extension is ALREADY installed in the target database (by a
#     binary pg_upgrade, or an ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE done outside the suite).
#     load.sql does not touch it; it only asserts presence + current version and
#     creates the test roles. Pair with CONTRIB_TESTDB=<db> and
#     EXTRA_REGRESS_OPTS=--use-existing so pg_regress runs against that database
#     instead of dropping and recreating a throwaway one.
#
# The mode (and the update from/to versions) are signalled to load.sql by
# placeholder GUCs. pg_regress does not forward make variables, but the psql
# processes it spawns inherit the environment, so PGOPTIONS reaches load.sql.
#
# The GUCs are exported UNCONDITIONALLY, so load.sql can read them WITHOUT
# missing_ok and fail loudly if they did not propagate. Relying on an absent GUC
# to mean "fresh" is unsafe: a silent break anywhere in the
# make -> PGOPTIONS -> env -> psql chain would quietly run the wrong mode.
#
# TEST_LOAD_SOURCE must be exactly `fresh`, `update` or `existing`; anything else
# is a hard error at parse time (so e.g. `make test TEST_LOAD_SOURCE=typo` fails
# fast rather than defaulting).
#
# An update must be committed (which is why it lives in test/install, not in
# deps.sql's per-test transaction): the update to the current version runs
# ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE, and a newly added enum value cannot be USED in the
# transaction that added it (55P04). See test/install/load.sql.
#
# update mode requires PG12+ when it targets the current version (ALTER TYPE
# ... ADD VALUE cannot run in a transaction at all before PG12); CI restricts it
# accordingly.

# GNU Make two-phase (parse vs. recipe) hazards involved (e.g.
# https://github.com/Postgres-Extensions/cat_tools/issues/28) and relies on
# base.mk/control.mk/PGXS vars (EXTENSION__CURRENT_VERSION__FILES, PG_CONFIG, MAJORVER,
# datadir, ...). The PGXNTOOL_ENABLE_TEST_INSTALL / TEST_LOAD_SOURCE vars above
# are set before this include so base.mk (pulled in by sql.mk) sees them.

# findings and make `make lint` unusable as a CI gate. Lint the current

# Static check that the update script into the current version accounts for

# LINT_TARGETS, its default scope excludes released pairs, whose files are
# frozen and whose findings could therefore never be fixed.
#
# CRITICAL: this must stay unwired from `lint` in both directions. `lint` only
# exists when lint.mk's vendored include fires, which is guarded on
# $(wildcard .git) -- in a released tarball there is no `lint` target at all
# and `make lint` fails loudly with "No rule to make target". Naming `lint` as
# a prerequisite here (or the reverse) would define it as a real target with no
# recipe, quietly turning that failure into a pass.
